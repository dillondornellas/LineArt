# Line Art using rectangular and circular coordinate systems
Reconstruct images using one continuous line based on average pixel intensities.
Copy of code made using circular boarder as opposed to rectangular edges of the image.

Modifiable options include:
- Number of lines to draw
- Node spacing / Number of nodes
- Visualizer Boolean

Returns node sequence to reproduce the image.

Sequence to interface with modified cartesian 3D printer to dispense twine around pins on a canvas to reproduce the image.
